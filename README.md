# My F# Chess Game
  
## Why
In order to learn about the many aspects of the programming language revolving data, I was tasked with creating a command line F# chess game.
Part of the difficulty is that I have (embarrissingly) never played Chess. So I have taken this as an opportunity to learn both.

## Current State of the Game
### Status : In Progress

- You can query a piece
- You can view the current board per update
- You now know whos turn it is
- You can move a piece from one square to another
    - If the piece lands on another piece, it captures that piece

### Upcoming Changes
- Move rules per rank
- Game in check
