# My F# Chess Game
  
## Why
In order to learn about the many aspects of the programming language revolving data, I was tasked with creating a command line F# chess game.
Part of the difficulty is that I have (embarrissingly) never played Chess. So I have taken this as an opportunity to learn both.

## Current State of the Game
### Status : In Progress

Currently, you can query a position and return a string to the console of the player and the rank of the piece.

### Upcoming Changes
- Move functionality
- Game Progress Status
- Player query
- Move rules per rank
